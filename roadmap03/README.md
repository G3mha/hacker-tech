**Author**: Enricco Gemha

**Date**: 04/19/2024

**Objective:** Creating a Firefox browser extension for detecting attacks and privacy breaches in web clients.

**Description:** Develop a tool capable of detecting and displaying:

- Connections to third-party domains during web browsing;
- The number of cookies injected during page loading;
- Detection of data storage (local storage) in the client via HTML5;
- Detection of cookie synchronization.

**Deliverables**: Develop a browser plugin capable of detecting and displaying:

- Connections to third-party domains during web browsing (2.5 points);
- Potential threats of browser hijacking and hooks (1 point);
- Detection of data storage (local storage - HTML5) on the user's device (2.5 points);
- The quantity of cookies and supercookies injected during page loading (if possible, differentiate between first-party and third-party cookies, as well as session or navigation cookies) (1 point);
- Detection of Canvas fingerprint (1 point).
- Create a scoring system based on a methodology (to be determined by the group), indicating whether the page respects user privacy (2 points).
